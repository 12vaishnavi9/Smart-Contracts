## âœ… Contracts Included

### **1. Hotel.sol**
A basic hotel booking contract where users can book a room by sending Ether. The owner of the contract receives the payment.

- Demonstrates:
  - `enum` to track room status
  - Handling payments with `msg.value`
  - Sending Ether using `transfer`

### **2. TodoList.sol**
A simple task manager where users can add tasks up to a limit and view their tasks.

- Demonstrates:
  - `mapping` to store tasks per user
  - `require` to enforce conditions
  - Returning data from functions

## ðŸ“– What I learned

- Writing Solidity smart contracts using Remix IDE
- Understanding blockchain concepts like accounts, transactions, and state
- Handling payments and writing conditional logic
- Using basic data structures like enums and mappings
- Managing permissions with `msg.sender`

## ðŸ›  Tools Used

- **Solidity 0.8.x** â€“ Programming language for smart contracts
- **Remix IDE** â€“ Browser-based development environment
- **Git & GitHub** â€“ Version control and collaboration platform

## ðŸš€ How to Run Locally

1. Open [Remix IDE](https://remix.ethereum.org/).
2. Create a new file and copy the code from this repository.
3. Compile the contracts using the Solidity compiler.
4. Deploy the contracts on test networks like Rinkeby or using Remixâ€™s JavaScript VM.
5. Interact with the functions through Remixâ€™s interface.
